<p class=one>Dream it....</p>
<p class=three>Success doesn't just find you.</p>
<p class=two>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.</p>
<p class=four>Courage is the first of human qualities because it is the quality which guarantees the others. I count him braver who overcomes his desires than him who conquers his enemies; for the hardest victory is over self. Quality is not an act, it is a habit. The energy of the mind is the essence of life.</p>
